The Fund invests in the currency markets. The Fund’s investment strategy
leverages the Investment Manager’s big-data and AI technology platform
to quantitatively monitor and analyse currency markets in real-time. The
investment process leads with real-time pattern recognition to determine
currency regime states. This flows to real-time signal derivation and
calibration for portfolio construction and systematic implementation of
investment exposures within the G-10 currency complex. Fund holdings
may include cash, Spot FX, FX Options, FX Swaps, FX Forwards, FX Futures
and options on FX Futures, positioning long and/or short.
